# **Access Modifiers in Java, C++, and C#**

Access modifiers are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. Below is a comparison of access modifiers in **Java**, **C++**, and **C#**.

## **1. Access Modifiers in Java**

| Modifier       | Class Scope | Package Scope | Subclass Scope | Global Scope |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **public**     | ✅           | ✅             | ✅              | ✅            |
| **protected**  | ✅           | ✅             | ✅              | ❌            |
| **default**    | ✅           | ✅             | ❌              | ❌            |
| **private**    | ✅           | ❌             | ❌              | ❌            |

### **Details**:
1. **public**:
   - Accessible from anywhere.
   - Commonly used for APIs and utility methods.

2. **protected**:
   - Accessible within the same package.
   - Accessible in subclasses outside the package through inheritance.

3. **default** (no modifier):
   - Accessible only within the same package.
   - Often used for package-private utilities.

4. **private**:
   - Accessible only within the same class.
   - Ensures strict encapsulation.

## **2. Access Modifiers in C++**

| Modifier       | Class Scope | Derived Class Scope | Global Scope |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **public**     | ✅           | ✅                   | ✅            |
| **protected**  | ✅           | ✅                   | ❌            |
| **private**    | ✅           | ❌                   | ❌            |

### **Details**:
1. **public**:
   - Members are accessible anywhere where the object is visible.
   - Used for APIs and interfaces.

2. **protected**:
   - Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
   - Common in inheritance for reusable logic.

3. **private**:
   - Members are accessible only within the class.
   - By default, members of a class are private in C++.

4. **Additional Notes in C++**:
   - **friend keyword**: Allows a specific class or function to access private and protected members of another class.
   - **Structs**: By default, members are `public` in structs (unlike classes where they're `private`).

## **3. Access Modifiers in C#**

| Modifier               | Class Scope | Derived Class Scope | Assembly Scope | Global Scope |
|------------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **public**             | ✅           | ✅                   | ✅              | ✅            |
| **protected**          | ✅           | ✅                   | ❌              | ❌            |
| **private**            | ✅           | ❌                   | ❌              | ❌            |
| **internal**           | ✅           | ❌                   | ✅              | ❌            |
| **protected internal** | ✅           | ✅                   | ✅              | ❌            |
| **private protected**  | ✅           | ✅ (only same assembly) | ❌          | ❌            |

### **Details**:
1. **public**:
   - Accessible from anywhere.

2. **protected**:
   - Accessible within the class and derived classes.

3. **private**:
   - Accessible only within the class.
   - Default for class members.

4. **internal**:
   - Accessible only within the same assembly.
   - Used for modular access within a project.

5. **protected internal**:
   - Accessible by derived classes or within the same assembly.
   - Combines `protected` and `internal`.

6. **private protected**:
   - Accessible by derived classes within the same assembly.
   - Provides a more restricted version of `protected`.

## **Summary Comparison**

| Feature/Language | Java                     | C++                | C#                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Public Scope      | `public`                | `public`           | `public`                   |
| Private Scope     | `private`               | `private`          | `private`                  |
| Protected Scope   | `protected`             | `protected`        | `protected`                |
| Package/Internal  | `default` (package)     | Not applicable     | `internal`                 |
| Advanced Scope    | Not applicable          | `friend` keyword   | `protected internal`, `private protected` |

## **Key Points**:
- Use **private** for encapsulation and data hiding.
- Use **protected** or equivalents for extensibility in inheritance.
- Use **public** for external access like APIs.
- Be cautious with **default/internal** access, as it might expose more than intended.
